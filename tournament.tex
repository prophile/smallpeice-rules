\section{Tournament Format}

The competition takes place in two phases: the league, and the knockouts.

\subsection{League}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item In the league stage, teams will face all other teams in a
        partial round-robin format.
  \item At the end of each match, \emph{league points} will be awarded as
        follows:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item A winning team will be awarded 3 points;
      \item A losing team will be awarded 1 point;
      \item A drawn team will be awarded 2 points;
      \item After points distribution, any disqualified or non-present teams
            have their awarded league points nullified for that match.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item At the end of the league, the total numbers of league points are used as
        seedings for a knockout structure. Teams that placed higher in the
        league will have to compete in fewer matches in the knockout --
        although, all teams will take part in the knockout and thus have a
        chance of winning.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Knockouts}

The knockouts span nine matches, with the format as follows:

\begin{center}
  \begin{tabular}{r|cc}

  \textbf{Match} & \textbf{Zone 0} & \textbf{Zone 1} \\
  \midrule
  Heat 1 & Seed 8
         & Seed 9 \\
  Heat 2 & Seed 7
         & Seed 10 \\
  QF 1 & Seed 1
       & Winner, Heat 1 \\
  QF 2 & Seed 4
       & Seed 5 \\
  QF 3 & Seed 2
       & Winner, Heat 2 \\
  QF 4 & Seed 3
       & Seed 6 \\
  SF 1 & Winner, QF 1
       & Winner, QF 2 \\
  SF 2 & Winner, QF 3
       & Winner, QF 4 \\
  Final & Winner, SF 1
        & Winner, SF 2 \\
  \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
\end{center}

All ties in the knockout stage are resolved by a decision from the Judge, taking
league position into consideration.
