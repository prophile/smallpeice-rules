\subsection{Arena}
\refstepcounter{SpecID}
\label{spec:arena}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The arena floor is an \SI{8}{m} $\times$ \SI{8.1}{m} rectangle. The
        tolerance of these two dimensions is $\pm$ \SI{250}{mm}.
  \item The floor of the arena is carpeted.
  \item The layout of the arena is given in Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
  \item The outer walls of the arena are at least \SI{600}{mm} high, and the
        interior surface is white plastic-coated hardboard.
  \item The robot starting zones are squares which share corners with the arena
        itself. Their sides are of length \si{1}{m}.
  \item In the centre of the arena is a central reservation raised by
        at least \SI{250}{mm} above the arena floor. It is square, and
        sized such that the width of the track is \SI{2}{m}.
  \item The track boundaries are visually delineated on the floor of the arena
        by tape. The actual boundary is on the trailing edge of the tape --
        that is, a robot has passed the boundary when the back of the robot
        is past the tape.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tin Cans}
\refstepcounter{SpecID}
\label{spec:cans}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The tin cans are standard 400g steel tin cans, of height \SI{108}{mm}
        ($\pm$ \SI{5}{mm}), and radius \SI{75}{mm} ($\pm$ \SI{5}{mm}).
  \item The initial layout of tokens in the arena is given in
        Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
  \item The tin cans are ferromagnetic.
\end{enumerate}
