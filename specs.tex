\subsection{Arena}
\refstepcounter{SpecID}
\label{spec:arena}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The arena floor is an \SI{8}{m} $\times$ \SI{8.1}{m} rectangle. The
        tolerance of these two dimensions is $\pm$ \SI{250}{mm}.
  \item The floor of the arena is carpeted.
  \item The layout of the arena is given in Figure~\ref{fig:arena}. This
        figure is to scale.
  \item The outer walls of the arena are at least \SI{600}{mm} high, and the
        interior surface is white plastic-coated hardboard.
  \item The outer track of the arena is \SI{1.5}{m} wide along the \SI{8}{m}
        edges, and \SI{1.55}{m} wide along the \SI{8.1}{m} edges.
  \item The central reservation is surrounded by walls at least \SI{179}{mm}
        high.
  \item The starting location of the robots is given in Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
        Teams are allowed to place their robot anywhere such that the entire
        robot is within \SI{1}{m} of the starting point, which will be
        indicated on the floor of the arena.
  \item There is a short-cut through the central reservation, as specified in
        Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
  \item Within the short-cut there are fixed obstacles. These are prismatic,
        with the area touching the floor being a square with edges of length
        \SI{200}{mm}. Their layout is given in Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
  \item In the centre of the arena is a pedestal holding the super token. The
        pedestal is \SI{179}{mm} high, and is a square with sides of length
        \SI{200}{mm}, rotated at 45\degree{} to the arena.
  \item The track boundaries are visually delineated on the floor of the arena
        by metal tape. The actual boundary is on the trailing edge of the tape
        -- that is, a robot has passed the boundary when the back of the robot
        is past the tape.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tin Cans}
\refstepcounter{SpecID}
\label{spec:cans}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item The tin cans are standard 400g steel tin cans, of height \SI{108}{mm}
        ($\pm$ \SI{5}{mm}), and radius \SI{75}{mm} ($\pm$ \SI{5}{mm}).
  \item The initial layout of tokens in the arena is given in
        Figure~\ref{fig:arena}.
  \item The tin cans are ferromagnetic.
\end{enumerate}
